"""Utilities for launching the development Express stack.

This module exposes :func:`launch_express_stack` which starts both the
Express API (``npm run dev``) and the BrowserSync proxy (``npm run ui``) and
keeps both processes alive until the user interrupts execution.  It aims to
be portable between Windows, macOS, and Linux by avoiding shell-specific
constructs and making sure the spawned processes are cleaned up on exit.
